# **App Name**: SwiftUnion Mobile Notification Redesign

## Core Features:

- Transfer Notification Display: Displays key information from the provided HTML document such as sender, receiver, amount, currency, and country.
- Personalized Greeting: Generate personalized welcome message based on user data, with culturally relevant greetings depending on their location using a tool.
- Secure Link to Receive: Provide a secure link for the user to seamlessly transition to the fund receiving process.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep rose (#C4497F), a saturated color with some boldness.
- Background color: Light pink (#F5E3E8), very close to the primary color in hue, but heavily desaturated for softness and readability.
- Accent color: Violet (#955299), chosen for good contrast, and in the same part of the color wheel.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif for headlines and body text.
- Crisp and modern vector icons to represent actions and status, such as a right-pointing arrow for the receive action.
- Use a card-based layout to present transfer information clearly, with subtle shadows to add depth. The edges of cards and buttons should have a large, rounded radius.
- Subtle animations for loading states and transitions to provide a smooth user experience.
